# rnn-autocomplete-suggestions-model
This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to suggest autocompletions for partially typed words. By inputting 3-4 letters (e.g., "univ"), the model predicts completions like "university." Trained on a dataset of 10,000 common English words from wordlist.txt, it uses the PyTorch library for efficient modeling.
